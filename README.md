# 🌍 My A11Y Journey

Welcome to **My Accessibility (A11Y) Journey** — a growing collection of my learnings, code snippets, and best practices for designing and developing accessible websites.

This repository is part of my ongoing study and advocacy for **digital accessibility in Kuwait**, encouraging developers and designers to build web experiences that everyone can use — regardless of ability.
